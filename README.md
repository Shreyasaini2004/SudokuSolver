# SudokuSolver

Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game played on a 9x9 grid, divided into 3x3 subgrids. The goal is to fill the grid with digits from 1 to 9 such that each row, column, and subgrid contains each digit exactly once. This project aims to implement a Sudoku solver that uses the backtracking algorithm to fill in the missing numbers in a given Sudoku puzzle.

A recursive approach to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
The algorithm will try filling each empty cell with a number from 1 to 9, checking if the current number placement is valid.
If a number placement leads to a conflict, the algorithm backtracks and tries the next number.
The process continues until the puzzle is solved or all possibilities are exhausted.
